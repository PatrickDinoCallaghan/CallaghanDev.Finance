# Quantitative Finance Library for .NET

This project combines a **Technical Analysis Library** and a custom **Quantitative Finance Library** to deliver an extensive suite of tools for technical analysis, trend analysis, and options pricing using the Black-Scholes model. The library is built for use in C# applications, facilitating a range of quantitative finance and trading strategies.

## Inspiration

This library draws inspiration from the excellent work done on [TA-Lib.NETCore](https://github.com/hmG3/TA-Lib.NETCore) by [hmG3](https://github.com/hmG3). Their project provides a comprehensive set of technical analysis functions for .NET Core, which served as the basis for shaping our technical analysis capabilities.

## Why We Didn't Fork

1. **Substantial Deviations**  
   We plan to make extensive changes and additions that diverge significantly from the original design.

2. **No Upstream Requirements**  
   We do not intend to submit changes upstream, which makes forking less appropriate. Instead, maintaining an independent codebase allows us to evolve the project freely without any obligation to align with the original repositoryâ€™s roadmap.
